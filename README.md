## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Crimes Dataset
This section contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted on the crimes dataset to identify trends and patterns in crime occurrences based on time and location.

## Crimes by Hour
`Description`:
This plot illustrates the number of crimes committed throughout the day, categorized by the victim's sex (`M` - Male, `F` - Female, `X` - Unknown, `H` - Hypothetical). The X-axis represents the hours of the day, while the Y-axis shows the count of crimes.

`Analysis`:
The plot reveals that the highest crime activity occurs at noon (`12 PM`), with significant peaks for both male and female victims. During the early morning hours (`0â€“6 AM`), crime activity is significantly lower but gradually increases towards noon. After noon, crime occurrences rise again and remain relatively high until late evening. This suggests that the majority of crimes happen during the day or evening, potentially indicating busier times when people are more active.

## Crimes by Area Name
`Description`:
This plot shows the number of crimes in different areas, broken down by the victim's sex. Each bar represents a specific area, with color coding indicating the victim's sex (`F` - Female, `M` - Male, `X` - Unknown, `H` - Hypothetical).

`Analysis`:
The `Central` area displays the highest crime rate among all victim categories, particularly for female victims. Other areas, such as `Hollywood`, `Southwest`, and `Olympic`, also exhibit high crime rates. This indicates that certain areas have a higher crime rate, possibly due to factors such as higher population density or socio-economic conditions. Analyzing these patterns can help in understanding crime dynamics and focusing law enforcement efforts in areas with elevated crime rates.

## Crimes per Age Group
`Description`:
This plot visualizes the density of crimes committed across different victim age groups. A kernel density estimate (KDE) plot is used to display the distribution of crimes for various age groups of victims. The X-axis represents the age of the victims(`0-17`,`18-25`,`26-34`,`35-44`,`45-54`,`55-64`, `65+`), while the Y-axis shows the density of crimes.

`Analysis`:
The `KDE` plot reveals how crime occurrences are distributed among different age groups. Peaks in the plot at `26-34` and `18-25` groups indicate that this age groups are in higher crime densities, showing which age ranges are more susceptible to being victims of crimes. This information can be valuable for understanding crime patterns based on age and can help in tailoring preventive measures or policies for different age demographics.
